# 🧩 Project Title
Microsoft Entra ID Tenant Deployment (Lab 1)

> **Completion Date:** 2025-11-10

---

## 🧭 Overview
Deployed and configured a Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant to establish foundational cloud identity management. Configured global administrative access, implemented multifactor authentication (MFA), and validated self-service password reset (SSPR) functionality to strengthen account recovery and access security controls.

---

## 📈 Qualified & Quantified Impact
- Established a fully functional Microsoft Entra ID tenant for hands-on IAM training
- Achieved 100% MFA enforcement for all administrative users
- Reduced account recovery time through SSPR testing and verification
- Enhanced IAM governance alignment with NIST CSF PR.AC and Zero Trust Identity principles

---

## 🧠 Core Objectives Met
- ☑ Objective 1 – Successfully deployed a Microsoft Entra ID tenant with custom configuration
- ☑ Objective 2 – Strengthened account protection through MFA and SSPR enforcement
- ☑ Objective 3 – Improved understanding of NIST and Zero Trust mappings within cloud identity services
